            <p>Switches are what mainly determines the sound signiture of each key stroke and there are two types:
                Tactile and linear. Tactile switches allow you to feel a bump indicating activation of the key whereas
                linear switches have no bump. There are a variety of different versions of both types of switches so
                it is recommended to trying out a few before committing to a whole bundle. In addition to their
                stock sound, you can add lube to significantly decrease the amount of scratchiness and smoothen 
                the sound.Because this is a basic guide, I will not go deep into 
                modding so here is a <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usNx1_d0HbQ">tutorial</a> if you are 
                interested.

            <p> Now that you have gathered your switches, it's time to discuss stabilizers.
                Stabilizer are required for keys that need to balance out a key press from any 
                direction such as the spacebar, shift key, delete key, and enter key. 
                For a 65% keyboard, we will using three 2u stabilizers and
                one 6.25u stabilizer. Stabilizers also affect the sound of a keyboard so be sure to
                be comfortable with whatever you choose. It is ideal to listen to sound comparisons 
                online, but do remember that they may not reflect how yours might sound due a variety 
				of reasons.
