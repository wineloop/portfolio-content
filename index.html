		<p>Many of have jobs that require us to sit in front of a computer screen using
			our keyboards for hours. So wouldn't it be nice to have a custom keyboard that is
			catered to your personality and sound preference? There is a diverse set of keycaps, 
			sounds, and feel that can make your typing experience that much better on a daily basis.
			However, be careful of the rabbit hole custom keyboards can create as entry level boards 
			can easily reach $100. Before we get into the nitty gritty details of building process,
			if you ever hear of an endgame keyboard, that is false. There is no endgame..
		</p>

		<p>Here is what is required to build a keyboard:
			keyboard 65% case, 65% PCB, plate, stabilizers, keycaps, roughly 70 switches, soldering iron, and solder.
			What is optional but recommended are: lube (krytox 205-g0 is most commonly used), switch opener,
			switch puller, desoldering pump (in the case you want to change the keyboard layout or mess up
			soldering a switch). Although most 65% keyboards use about 67 switches, it is recommended to always 
			buy slightly more. This is in the case that you accidentally break a pin off the switch or lose one.
